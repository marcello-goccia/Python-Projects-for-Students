3.6 Input and output devices
You now know how a computer processes data, but how does it receive that data and
how do we see the result of the processing? This is possible through the use of input
and output devices.
An input device is any device that allows data to be entered into a computer system.
This data could take many forms including text, images and sound.
Common examples of input devices are:
• barcode scanner
• digital camera
• keyboard
• microphone
• optical mouse
• QR code scanner
• scanner (2D and 3D)
• touch screen (resistive, capacitive and infra-red).

An output device is any device that allows the result of the data processing to be seen or heard. Common examples of output devices are: • actuator • digital light processing (DLP) projector • inkjet printer
• laser printer
• light emitting diode (LED) screen
• liquid crystal display (LCD) projector
• liquid crystal display (LCD) screen
• speaker
• 3D printer.

Many computer systems that you encounter in your daily life are automated systems.
You can learn more about what an automated system is and how they work in
Chapter 6.
A type of input device called a sensor is used in an automated system. The sensor is
used to capture different types of data to be processed by the system. The sensor
captures analogue data from its immediate surrounding environment. This data can
then be processed and analysed by a computer system. Sensors are normally set to
capture data at given time intervals. This could be as constant as every single second or
even fraction of a second. It could also be set to be every minute or at particular times
of the day.
Table 3 .1 shows the different types of sensor that you need to know, a description of
the type of data that they capture and an example of a how they might be used.

level of sound. If it captures a reading that shows a sudden
increase in sound, this could mean that the window has
been broken and the building may be at risk.

Magnetic field This type of sensor measures the
presence of magnetic field that
may be emitted by an object.
Moisture This type of sensor measures the
amount of water that is present
in a substance, such as soil.
pH This type of sensor measures the
pH level of a substance.
Pressure This type of sensor measures the
force of pressure that is applied
to the sensor or device. This
could be the pressure created
by a solid object, or it could be
created by liquid or gas.
Proximity This type of sensor measures
how close an object is in
comparison to the sensor. It does
this by emitting electromagnetic
radiation or an electromagnetic
field and measures the radiation
as it returns to see if there are
any changes.
Temperature This type of sensor measures
the temperature of an object
or substance by either directly
touching it or capturing
data from the surrounding
environment.
Example of its use
These sensors can be used to count how many cars pass
through a certain area, for example into a car park. The
car will disrupt the Earth's naturally magnetic field as it
passes over the sensor and the data can be captured by
the sensor.
These sensors can also be used by farming and
agriculture, to make sure that the fruits and vegetables
have the best level of water in the soil to help them grow.
These sensors can be used by environmental agencies to
make sure that local lakes and river are not being polluted.
These sensors could also be used in a security system.
They can be placed at the base or sides of an opening,
such as a window or a door. When that window or door
is opened, the pressure will decrease, and the system will
recognise that an intruder has entered.
These types of sensors can be used in robots in
manufacturing. They allow the robots to measure how
close they are to different objects, when moving
around a factory.
These types of sensors are used in air conditioning
systems. They allow the temperature of a room to be kept
at a certain level.

3.7 Data storage
You need to store data in a computer system on a constant basis. This might be
temporarily, whilst it is being processed, or on a more permanent basis for future use.
For these purposes, there are two main categories of storage that exist in a computer,
they are primary storage and secondary storage.
Primary storage is a category of storage that is directly accessed by the CPU. This
means that the CPU has a direct connection to it and that data is sent between the CPU
and the primary storage using this connection. There are two main types of primary
storage, random access memory (RAM) and read only memory (ROM). There are several
characteristics of each type of primary storage, these include those shown in Table 3.2:
Characteristics of RAM Characteristics of ROM
It is volatile storage. This mean that It is non-volatile. This means that if
it requires power to store data. If the power is removed, the contents of
power is turned off, the contents of RAM the ROM are retained. Non-volatile
are lost. Volatile storage is sometimes storage is sometimes referred to as
referred to as temporary storage. permanent storage.
It stores data and programs that are It stores programs that initially boot
currently in use by the computer. the computer, such as the bootstrap
and the BIOS.
Its contents are constantly being The contents of ROM are fixed

complex process and only normally
attempted in circumstance when a
computer system is failing to
boot correctly.
It is possible to increase the amount It is not easy to alter the ROM
of RAM a computer has by adding available in a computer system.
further RAM components
Secondary storage is a category of storage that is not directly accessed by the CPU.
This means that data and instructions need to be sent from secondary storage into
primary storage in order for it to be processed. Secondary storage is also a type of
non-volatile storage. Can you remember what this means? There are three main types
of secondary storage, these are magnetic, optical and solid-state storage.
Magnetic storage relies on the properties of magnetism to store data. A modern
magnetic storage device normally has circular plates called platters that spin to allow
data to be read and written. The platters are separated into tracks and sectors. It has
a read/write head that moves across the platters to read or write the data. It uses an
electromagnet to magnetise dots on each platter that store the data. If a dot is
magnetised it stores the binary value 1. If a dot is demagnetised it stores the binary
value 0. Each platter has billions of these magnetised dots. An example of this type
device is called a hard disk drive.

In 1956, a technology company called IBM sold the first hard disk drive. It had a
storage capacity of just 5 MiB of data and cost $50 000! Thankfully, hard disk
drives have become much cheaper to buy and have a much larger storage capacity
now. Another type of storage that became available to buy around 1982 is optical
storage. People originally thought optical storage would replace hard disk drives,
but soon realised that they could not be made with a high enough capacity to
do this.
Optical storage uses lasers to read and write data to and from a circular disk. The
disk spins and a read/write heads moves across the surface to allow data to be read
or written. To write data, a laser burns pits into the surface of the disk. These pits
are organised in a spiral track that starts at the centre of the disk. The surface of the
disk between each pit is called a land. A laser is also used to read the pits and lands
to obtain the data that they store. Examples of optical media are a CD, DVD and a
Blu-ray. Two of those examples are read using a red laser and one is read using a blue
laser, can you guess which is which?

Although optical storage is still used today, it is mostly used to archive data or as a
cheap way to physically distribute files to users that require them. They didn't replace
hard drives in the way that it was first thought they would. As portable devices
developed, people began to realise there was a disadvantage with hard disk drives.
This disadvantage came from the fact that they have moving parts. This made them
vulnerable to wear and tear and also damage if they were dropped. As a result, a new
type of storage was developed called solid-state storage.
Solid state storage doesn't have any moving parts. Instead it is created using
semiconductor chips. Solid-state storage is sometimes known as flash memory. This
is because of the ways that the data is read and written to the chips, it is said that it
is 'flashed' onto them, but how does that happen? Solid state storage contains
cells and transistors that are laid out in a grid. The transistors can be wired together
in two different ways. In a NOR flash structure, the cells are wired together in a
parallel structure. In a NAND flash structure, the cells are wired together in series.
The intersection of the rows and columns of transistors are the cells. One of the
transistors is called a control gate and one of the transistors is called a floating gate.
The control gate sits on top of the floating gate. When a solid state storage device is
first created, all the transistors are set to the binary value 1. The electric current
reaches each control gate and then flows through to the floating gate to be stored.
When data is stored in a transistor, it is converted to the binary value 0. A solid
state drive is one example of a solid state storage device. You probably use another
example on a regular basis too, it's called a USB flash memory drive (also known as
USB stick, memory stick or a thumb drive).

3.8 Virtual memory
So far, all the storage that you have learnt about has been physical storage. This means
that it is an actual component storage unit that you can see and touch. There is another
type of storage that can be created in a computer and this is called l'irtual memory. It is
called virtual memory, as unlike physical storage, it isn't a component that you can see
or touch.
You may have noticed that this chapter includes the term memory and storage. You
may find these used interchangeably in lots of different resources. There is a slight
difference between the two, but even the defined difference is a little contradictory.
Technically, memory is used as a term for short term temporary storage of data, and
storage is used as a term for the permanent storage of data. For example, RAM stores
data temporarily and is a type of memory, random access memory. A hard disk drive
is a type of storage as it stores data permanently, until the user deletes it. This seems a
simple distinction, but ROM is also a type of memory, read only memory, but it stores
data permanently too. Therefore, the difference is not completely clear, but it is mostly
considered that memory is temporary and storage is permanent. However, you don't
need to become too worried about picking the correct term!
Virtual memory is also a type of memory that is created for temporary use. It is created
as an extension to RAM. Sometimes, a computer is given a large number of tasks to
complete at a given time. This means that it will need a lot of data to do this. All this
data will need to be sent to the RAM to be ready to be processed. A computer system
only has a set amount of RAM, so what happens when this RAM becomes full? It
needs some extra help! This is where virtual memory can help.
Virtual memory is created in a computer system with a hard drive component.
A section of that hard drive is partitioned off and is effectively an extra bit for RAM
instead. When the RAM gets full, the computer system can transfer some data to
the virtual memory to be held there until it is needed. It will choose to send data that
isn't as immediately required as other data. The data that is transferred is collected in
a structure called a page. These pages of data are transferred to the virtual memory
to make sure there is enough room in the RAM for the immediate data that is being
processed. Once the pages of data are required again, they can be sent back to the
RAM to be processed. The diagram in Figure 3.13 shows the process:

If the RAM became full and the computer did not have the ability to transfer pages
of data to the virtual memory, this could cause it to crash, as it may not be able to
complete the task it is currently working on.

3.9 Cloud storage
Despite a common misconception that many people have, cloud storage does not store
our data somewhere up in the clouds. So how did it get that name? It is more in relation
to the very large collections of data that are stored being like clouds of data, think
clouds of millions of raindrops!
As technology has developed, and continues to do so, people have found that they want
and need to store larger amounts of data, and data storage is quite expensive to buy,
keep and maintain.
You might be able to make sure that your 2 Terabyte hard drive at home is safe in your
house and is checked regularly for security issues, but it's likely you only have a relatively
small amount of data to store. Some multinational businesses have huge amounts of
data to store. This can require large rooms that are needed to house expensive hardware,
such as computer servers, to store all the data that the company requires. This could be
the details of millions of their customers and all the online transactions they have made
to buy products. They would also need staff to maintain this equipment and keep that
data safe. These kinds of costs could amount to many thousands of pounds a year for a
business. Therefore, cloud storage offers them an alternative.
Cloud storage companies created a service in which they set up very large buildings
that house and maintain thousands of computer servers. They spend 24 hours a day
making sure the servers are maintained and secure. A company can then pay a fee
to the cloud storage company for their service, to be allowed to store their data on
their servers and pass the responsibility to the company to keep it secure until it is
required. The company then accesses this data, when it is required, using the internet.
Cloud storage is a collection of third party hardware (hardware
that is owned by another person or organisation), such as
computer servers, that individuals and companies can use to store
data, and for a range of other services. When data is stored within
the buildings and hardware owned by the individual or business,
this is known as storing the data locally. When data is stored in
hardware owned by a third party and accessed using the internet,
this is known as storing data remotely.
Cloud storage began as a simple way to offload the responsibility
of storing data. Since it was first used, it has developed into use
for other services. For example, a business can now use cloud
storage in connection to its website. The cloud storage company
can offer a service whereby when demand is high for a website, such
as they have a big sale, then they can use cloud storage to extend
3 Hardware
the capabilities of the web servers to be able to process the large
amounts of data and requests that are being sent to the website.
This means that the company can use hardware they do not own, on
occasions when the demand for their business is high. This means
they do not need to own all the hardware used, and have the extra
hardware not being used, and therefore wasting money for them,
when their business demand is lower. Helpful for business costs!
Some people do have concerns about cloud storage. They think it is a big risk
to give someone else the responsibility for looking after their data. Table 3.3 gives
comparisons of some advantages and disadvantages of storing data in the cloud and
storing it locally.

need to store has decreased.

3.10 Network hardware
At the beginning of this chapter, you learnt about the hardware required within a
computer and local to a computer that enable the temporary and permanent storage of
data. You have now learnt that data can be stored remotely, in a cloud storage system,
but that an internet connection is required to access the data stored in the cloud.
The hardware required for this connection creates a network. You will now learn what
hardware is required to create a connection to other devices and the internet.
When two or more devices are connected, this is called a network. Some basic hardware
devices are required to create a network, these are a network interface card (NJC),
a router and you may need some transmission media.
Within your computer or device is a piece of hardware called a NIC. This may be
a wired or wireless NIC. This means that either a cable will be plugged into the
hardware to connect to a network, or it will have a
wireless component that allows it to make a wireless
connection. Most modern NICs are
wireless NICs (WNICs).

Each NIC is given an address called a media access control (MAC) address.
This address can be used to identify a device on a network.
A MAC address is assigned by the manufacturer and is never normally changed. It will
remain assigned to the device whilst it is in use. A MAC address is made up of two main
parts. These are the manufacturers ID code and the Serial ID code for the device. This
creates a unique address for each device. The address is represented as hexadecimal and
normally has six pairs of numbers, separated with either a dash or a colon, for example:
34 :4D : EA: 89: 75: B2
When a device with a network interface card transmits data across a network, it will
send the MAC address of that device with the data. This means that it is possible to
tell, from inspecting the data, which device on the network the data was sent from.

When data is sent across a network, a hardware device can be used to make sure that
the data arrives at the correct destination. You can use a hardware device called a router
to do this. Will a router have a NIC? Does this mean it will have a MAC address? See if
you can find out! Each device that wants to connect to the internet will also need to do
this by connecting to the router. This could be a wired or wireless connection.
A router is a hardware device that reads each data packet that it receives. Details about
data packets and their structure was covered in Chapter 2. The router reads the data
packets to find out the destination of the data. It can use the MAC address to do this,

but that will normally only be used if the data is sent to another device that is part of
the same local network (this is a network that is contained within a specific area, such
as your house). As a router is also used to connect a device or a local network to the
internet, it is the internet protocol (IP) address of the destination device that is
normally read and used to forward the data to its correct destination.
This IP address can also be used to locate your device on a network, and it is also a unique
address. It is different in structure to a MAC address, as it is assigned by the network,
rather than by the manufacturer. In a local network, such as a home network, it is often
the router that assigns the IP address to a device, when it is connected to the router.
An IP address can have different structures, such an IPv4 or IPv6 structure. IPv4 was
the first structure created for an IP address. This structure was created back in 1983 and
uses 32-bits to create each numerical IP address. Even though it is now an old structure,
there are still many devices that have an IPv4 address. An example of an IPv4 address is:
12.244.233.165
As more and more devices started connecting to networks, the number of available
JPv4 addresses started to rapidly decline. As each IP address needs to be unique to the
device, they were rapidly running out, due to the number of devices worldwide. IPv6
was created as result, to create more available IP addresses. IPv6 uses 128-bits to create
an IP address. IPv6 addresses can also contain hexadecimal characters. This created
much more possibilities for IP addresses and allowed them to remain unique to the
device. An example of an IPv6 address is:
2001 :0db8 :0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:7879
You will also notice that an IPv4 address is separated by full stops, but an IPv6 address
is separated by colons.
An IP address can also be either static or dynamic. Most devices are assigned a
dynamic IP address. This means that the address can change each time the device is
connected to a network. The device may be given that IP address for a single session
that it connects to the router, or it may be given it for several sessions before it changes,
but it will change at some point. It is possible to obtain a static IP address for your
device. This means that the IP address for your device will be the same every time that
you connect your device to a network, it will not change, until you request it to be
changed, it will always remain the same. It is normally your Internet Service Provider
that will provide you with a static IP address for your device.
