**Title:**
Calculate Parallel Resistor Value

**Description:**  
For resistors with resistances ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ), the formula for calculating the total resistance in parallel is given. Input the values of two resistors as floating-point numbers, and output the total resistance, rounded to two decimal places.

**Input Description:**  
Two resistor values as floating-point numbers, separated by a space.

**Output Description:**  
The total resistance after connecting them in parallel, rounded to two decimal places.

**Input Sample 1:**  
`1 2`

**Output Sample 1:**  
`0.67`
