## Title
Earth's Population Carrying Capacity Estimate

## Description
Assume that Earth's new resources grow at a constant rate. Based on this estimate, the existing resources on Earth, combined with the new resources, can support a population of x billion people for a certain number of years, or  y billion people for another number of years. To achieve sustainable development and avoid resource depletion, what is the maximum population Earth can support?

## Input Description
One line contains four integers. One line contains four integers x, a, y, and b, separated by a space. The conditions are x>y, a<b, and a*x<b*y. Each integer is no greater than 10,000.

## Output Description
One real number z, representing the maximum population Earth can support, rounded to two decimal places.
